## Critical Path

`0.7 → 0.8/0.10 → 1.2 → 1.4 → 2.3 → 3.3 → 5.4 → 6.1`
(Docs approved → env ready → graph produced → smells found → crew runs → token study → report.)

## Definition of Done (project)

All P0 tasks ☑, every quality gate in Phase 7 green, and the acceptance criteria in
[`PRD.md` §2.3](PRD.md) satisfied on at least one target repository.
